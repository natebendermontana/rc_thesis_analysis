# RCthesisanalysis
Analysis of National Survey data for Resource Conservation master's thesis


From Nate:
> Thanks for sending that video on over v under-fitting. That does help conceptually. I think my biggest problem on the thesis analysis though is translating that conceptual understanding to the "weeds" of fitting & testing a model in R. I feel quite lost and uncertain. I'm also not very proud of the R code; there's a lot of inefficiency in how I've coded things so far. Work in progress.Can I send along the data and R code so you can review at your convenience and we can discuss? Any insight you can give to help me better understand the forest for the trees in this analysis would be greatly appreciated.The cliffnotes summary of my status here is I have cleaned the data, reduced the number of levels on categorical variables as needed, ran a factor analysis on the continuous variables, and done a listwise deletion of incomplete data based on the composite variables created from the factor analysis. I've fit an ordinal regression model using all of the variables (based on theory) that I think could be predictive, but I'm not confident I'm thinking about the process correctly overall, and I'm having trouble getting the goodness-of-fit and tests of OLR assumptions set up correctly.R code & data (it's a relatively small file so I just threw it in the repo) are below. I invited you to the private repo so you should have access.
